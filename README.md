## Usage

The stimuli are organized into the following folders:

- `Cue/` â€” [cue videos]
- `Feedback-AgentDep/` â€” [feedback videos in the Agent Dependent condition]
- `Feedback-AgentIndep/` â€” [feedback videos in the Agent Independent condition]
- `editedscreenshots/` - [screen shot images used for participants to make predictions]
  

Each video has a unique video number to match for cue and feedback videos.


These stimuli were used to examine possible neural instantiation of the predictive processing in the social cognition domain.  
Please refer to the **Methods** section in the preprint for detailed information on how the stimuli were used in the task.
